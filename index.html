                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hey there! Hopefully me covered in snow is not too much of a shocker! lol I'm Ian Lu, currently diving deep into the world of Computer Science as a Master's student at Cornell Tech. Before this, I was at the University of Washington, where I got my BS in Informatics. I made it to the Deanâ€™s List, which was pretty cool!</p>
                
                <h3>My Journey</h3>
                <p>I spent a couple of summers at Amazon, where I got to play with AWS and build some pretty neat systems. One summer, I worked on a high-throughput event-driven system, and another, I helped create a Centralized Configuration System. Both were challenging but super rewarding!</p>
                
                <p>Before Amazon, I was at Costco IT, where I got my hands dirty with Spring Boot and Azure. I also co-founded Utorify, an educational social media platform. We built a cross-platform app with Flutter and even integrated some AI magic with GPT-3.5 Turbo. Leading a team across different time zones was a wild ride!</p>
                
                <h3>Teaching and Robotics</h3>
                <p>Teaching is another passion of mine. At UW, I was a Teaching Assistant, helping students navigate web development. I also joined the Advanced Robotics team, where we worked on Project-Otto. We even won the RoboMaster North American Championship twice!</p>
                
                <h3>Skills and Hobbies</h3>
                <p>When it comes to skills, I dabble in a bit of everything: Java, Python, Dart, and more. I love frameworks like React and Flutter, and I'm always exploring new tools like AWS and Docker. Outside of tech, I'm into tennis and music. Let's connect and chat about anything tech or tennis!</p>
